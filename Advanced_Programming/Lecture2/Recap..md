## Notes:
### <li> Turing test is a procedure to check if a machine is intelligent or not
### <li> Turing machine is designed to give a principle solution to the problem, if the data get's larger it's doable but will take time, not designed to be serve efficiency.  
### <li> Turing Thesis state that any algorithm can be implemented by a turing machine.

### <li> Turing Complete language is a language that can implement any algorithm.

### <li> Latex and AWK are turing complete languages although they are not designed to be one, also high level languages are turing complete.

### <li> Sql and regular expressions are not turing complete.
