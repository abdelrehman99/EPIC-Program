## Q1)
### since that 2n + 3 will always be odd, and when it's not prime it will be divisible by 3, and n + 7 will be divisible by 3 in some cases when n = 2, 20, so the largest is when n = 4 because both ends will be = 11 
### GCD(2n + 3, n + 7) when n = 4
### GCD(11, 11) = 11

## Q2)
### According to euler's theorem 
$$
a^{φ(m)} ≡ 1 \mod(m)
$$
### since
$$
a^{φ(143)} ≡ 120
$$
### then 
$$
7^{120} ≡ 1 \mod (143)
$$

## Q3)
### According to euler's theorem 
$$
a^{φ(m)} ≡ 1 \mod(m)
$$
### we can then look for m as 10000
$$
3^{4000} ≡ 1 \mod(10000)
$$
### since that  
$$
φ(10000) = 4000
$$

## Q4)
### Since that the prime factors of 52 are 2, 2, 13, Then to find n that it satisfies that $$ 52^n $$ does not divide 2023!.
### Then the number of 13's must exceed the number of 13's in $$ 52^n $$  
### so the sum of 13's in 2023 is 12090, then the answer is 12091
$$ n = 12091 $$  

## Q5)
### Since the lcm(11, 9) is 99 then our answer is 999999099999 and 999999100000.
